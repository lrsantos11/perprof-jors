We have separated our implementation in a way that facilitates the creation of a
new backend.
We define a class {\tt Pdata} which stores the parsed data ($\mathcal{P}$,
$\mathcal{S}$, $t_{s,p}$, etc.) and define methods to create the profile data
$r_{p,s}$.
The backends are classes that extend {\tt Pdata} defining a method {\tt plot}
which creates the expected figure.
The user shall have little difficult creating his own backend, specially if he
uses one of our own as a starting point.

Our parser opens the input files and creates the information for {\tt Pdata}.
Replacing this parser (for use with out backends) would not be so easy
because the user would have to create the correct output format.  However,
extending it with additional options would be simple enough.

Our entry point {\tt perprof-py} essentially collects the options from the command
line and calls the specific backend profiler. This can be completely bypassed
by calling the backend directly. This allows the user to create a performance
profile from another python application. In particular, one possibility is the
creation of a graphical user interface (GUI)
or a web server application. The modularity of the package
allows whoever desires to construct this interface to focus entirely on
obtaining the options from the user and passing it to the backend.

Whether you're planning on expanding some of our functionalities or creating any
new backend or interface, please connect with us through our project page on
