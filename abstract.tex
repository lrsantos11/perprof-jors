A very important area of research in the field of Mathematical Optimization is the benchmarking of
optimization packages to compare solvers.
During benchmarking, one usually
collects a large amount of information like CPU time, number of functions
evaluations, number of iterations, and much more. This information, if
presented as tables, can be difficult to analyze and compare due to
large amount of data.  Therefore 
tools to better process and understand optimization benchmark data have been developed. One of
the most widespread tools is the \emph{Performance Profile} graphics proposed by
\textcite{Dolan:2002du}. In this context, this paper describes perprof-py, a free/open source software
that creates Performance Profile graphics. This software produces graphics in PDF using LaTeX with
PGF/TikZ~\cite{TikZ} and PGFPLOTS~\cite{pgfplots} packages, in
PNG using matplotlib~\cite{Hunter:2007}, and in HTML using
Bokeh~\cite{url:bokeh}. Perprof-py  can also be easily
extended to be used with other plot libraries. It is implemented
in Python 3 with support for internationalization, and is under the General
Public License Version 3 (GPLv3).
